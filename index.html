                              <p class="sub-heading">HTML5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
                              <p>This is a project I worked on while learning CSS, HTML, and Photoshop. It is a sample of a business site. It was my second attempt at creating a website through using everything that I learned in my first class with Skillcrush. It was a great feeling when I was able to complete it. </p>

                              <p class="sub-heading">HTML5 & CSS Website</p>
                              <p>This was the first website I was able to code myself! It is a sample of a portfolio page or online resume. It was definitely challenging and I got stuck a few times throughout the process but it was such a rewarding feeling once I completed it. It was great to see everything come together at the end.</p>

                              <p class="sub-heading">HTML5 & CSS Exercise</p>
                              <p>This was one of my first projects when learning to code. It required us to replicate the Holstee Manifesto. In doing so we were able to use some of the core HTML and CSS material we learned through the course. It was a lot of fun, and great practice for future projects.</p>
