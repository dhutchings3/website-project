                  <p>I&#39;m currently enrolled in the Skillcrush blueprint development course and learning all that I can about web development. I love learning new topics and growing my skill set each day. The support and structure I have received so far in the course is what keeps me motivated to continue this path!</p>

        <h2>A little bit more about me.</h2>
        <div class="half-width">
          <p>I&#39;ve spent most of my life in Upstate New York, where I grew up and went to college for Marketing. I continued on to get my MBA and then began work at a national advertising agency specializing in Podcast and YouTube direct repsonse campaigns. In the last year I've completely uprooted and started a new adventure in Fort Worth, Texas where I continue to work in Digital Marketing. My journey into tech actually began right out of college when I had some interest in creating a blog.  When considering starting a blog I began researching all the steps involved and found my self extremly engaged when learning about word press and some of the code that was necessary to create such asethetically pleasing and user friendly Wordpress Themes. I felt like it opened a door to this tech world of knowledge that I had been missing all my life. I tabled learning more in depth at the time due to a full plate with work but I eventually revisted and realized this was something I truly wanted to pursue.</p>

          <p>After moving to Texas, I realized I had some free time on my hands and looked into some ways I might be able to earn an extra income. After listening to a few podcasts and repeadily hearing coding as a recommendation I decided to revisit this interest. I began taking some free courses and listening to coding podcasts and again I was immersed into learning something that was so interesting to me. It felt so great to be learing something that excited me again. I eventually signed up for a paid course and am in the process of that right now. I'm currently continuing to learn and plan to one day take this hobby and turn in into a career.</p>
